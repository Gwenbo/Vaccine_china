### code prep for sensitivity for immunosenescent waning ###

#replace #vaxgen oldwanes with the relevant scenario below. 
#Or could write it in to a loop
# these are for 20yr duration of protection, will need doing for 10y if wanted, but think sensitiviy analysis should be for just one scenario?

oldwane0<-oldwane+oldwaneto0
  
oldwane1<-oldwane+oldwaneto1
  
oldwane5<-oldwane+oldwaneto5
